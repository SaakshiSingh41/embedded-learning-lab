# 🛠️ Embedded Systems Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Embedded Systems and Arduino-based projects**! This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in embedded systems and IoT, as part of the **certified course by GeeksforGeeks**.

All projects are built using **Tinkercad simulations** and/or the **Arduino IDE**, covering real-world hardware interactions through code.
| Project Name                      | Description                                               | Tinkercad Link |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Traffic Light Signal Simulation  | LED traffic signal using timing logic and digital pins    | https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kNWa8LVey4y-traffic-light-simulation/editel?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinkercad.com%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2Fcircuits&sharecode=6ePFJLRuzrfA3HjLLMua-yFvaCeLPlMAAp5n5HMNsPk |
| LED-Buzzer Tone Control          | Different buzzer tones on each LED signal state           |https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dMS8cOtoRXx-incredible-vihelmo/editel?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinkercad.com%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2Fcircuits&sharecode=sdSPSUoEhvzGxgftslwOXfRx0botx2ykfY775QBcqt8|
